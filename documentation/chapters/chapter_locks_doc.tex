The kernel provides several different locking mechanisms, each with their own advantages
and disadvantages.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{atomic operations} are the fastest, but also only safe
for single variable data modifications.
\item \textbf{mutexes} are still quite fast, but have no distinction between
reading or writing. These will cause a process to block until it can acquire the lock.
\item \textbf{reader/writer locks} are slower than mutexes, but allow better control
over what a process may do with a set of data. These allow for much better safe concurrent
access. These may cause processes to block as well.
\end{itemize}
