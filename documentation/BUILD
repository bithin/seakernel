Building - Linux
----------------

NOTE: THE BUILD SYSTEM IS NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK EVERYWHERE.

* Run "./configure". <--Must only be run once.
	This will check your system for required programs and also start the configuration system for the kernel.

* Run "make toolchain". <--Must only be run once.
	This will build the toolchain used to build the applications.

* Run "make all".
	This will compile and link the kernel, drivers, modules, and applications.
	This will also create the hd image used by emulators.
	
* To test, run "make test".
	This will start Qemu automatically.

* 'make all' will run both make os and make image.

A shortcut, once configure has been run, is "make all test"
