Known Bugs include:
 * running ./configure on packages that use config.guess to figure out the
   system name will result in them not being able to figure out the build system.
   workaround: run ./configure --build=i586-pc-seaos
 * Various display errors in ncurses applications sometimes due to the features
   listed in the termcap file not being fully implemented yet
 * Running man will result in 'less' complaining that the terminal is not
   fully functional
 * If you read/write enough data to and from block devices, eventually the
   system will run out of memory. This is because there is currently no limit
   on the cache (will be fixed for beta-2)
 * There is a memory leak if you run a shell script. Looks like 4KB per run
 * Make doesn't seem to recompile targets if their sources change
 * There is nothing preventing circular links from causing a stack overrun
 * Make doesn't like running with the job server (-j*) - results in "interrupted
   system call"
 * df doesn't seem to properly report disk usage
 * device or resource busy when unmounting /mnt
Things that need more testing:
 * loop devices
 * file locks
 * compiling GNU software on the system

Todo:
	* event system (register events, blocking for IO...)
	  such that a high priority process will get automatically resched'd if it unblocks
Roadmap:
0.2 B2
	* bugfixes
	* remove all code thats not mine from the kernel
	* redesign locking
	* split out arch dependent stuff
	* add atomic operations, and implement accordingly
	* finalize build system
	* add if statements to config files
	* really stabilize kernel
	* interrupt context
	* where to send ctrl-c to?

0.2 B3
	* new random driver
	* add chaining to file descriptors (and modify the return value for the sysconf entry)
	* mmfiles
	* limit cache size
	* can compile GNU software
	* port ruby
	* system call conditions (like iptables)
	* user-space io port access

0.2 RC1
	* All ported software works properly
	* documentation
	* link looks at directory permissions
	* no clobbering of strings
	* make sure all features listed in termcap are properly implemented
	* fix memory leaks (sh <script> has a leak)

0.2: good userspace system and stable single-cpu kernel

0.3 B1
	* smp
	* mutexes work in smp
	* bugfixes
0.3 B2
	* sockets
	* implement userspace drivers and allowing ring-3 writing of IOports

0.3 RC1
	* documentation
	* optimizations

0.3: basic SMP support, good IPC (sockets), bugfixes, feature completion. Good kernel. Possibility of userspace drivers

0.4: Networking, drivers, more software, optimizations.

0.5: Fully installable and usable OS
